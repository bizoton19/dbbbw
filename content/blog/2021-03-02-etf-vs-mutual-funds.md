A lot of folks confused ETFâ€™s and mutual funds as being the same. The biggest similarity between them is that both represent professionally managed collections, or baskets, of individual stocks, bonds or other securities.\
\
Because of that they are well diversified and are less risky than individual stocks or bonds.\
\
The biggest face value difference in my opinion is control. If you want to have more control over the price of your trade then ETF is the way since they trade like stocks. Mutual funds on the other end, you wonâ€™t know the price until after the trading day is over. Though that also makes is appealing to passive investors who donâ€™t see the price fluctuations throughout the day.\

Both are great investment vehicle but as always do your research to see which one is more your style. You know know, you may have a portfolio with both ðŸ˜ƒ
