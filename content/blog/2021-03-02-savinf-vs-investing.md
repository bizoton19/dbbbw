 I was so happy to see this post from [@investingpadi](https://www.instagram.com/investingpadi/). This epitomized how I think people are investing compared to leaving the money in their savings account.\
\
The fear of separation from that money is real for a lot of people as they think the money that is being investing is going to disappear.\
\
Let me say this, the Fear you have about not investing your money is asking risking your future.\

Want to know what I mean by this? DM me with any questions!\
